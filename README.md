# react-non-conformist-knob.

A non conformist knob to use with react.
After being un-happy with current selection of knobs while working on one of my projects, decided to create this using three.js for some cooler user experience.

Demo: https://alexjilkin.github.io/react-non-conformist-knob/
## Usage
```JSX
<Knob value={} onChange={} min={} max={} color={} title={}/>
```
